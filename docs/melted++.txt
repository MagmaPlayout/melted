Servers and Westley Docs
------------------------

	One of the key features of MLT is its server capabilities. This feature
	allows you to pass westley documents seamlessly from one process to 
	another and even to different computers on your network. 

	The miracle playout server is one such example of an application which 
	uses this functionality - you can build your own servers into your own
	processes with ease.

	A server process would be running as follows:

	    #include <mlt++/Miracle>
	    using namespace Mlt;
	
	    int main( void )
	    {
	        Miracle miracle( "miracle", 5250 );
	        miracle.start( );
	        miracle.execute( "uadd sdl" );
	        miracle.execute( "play u0" );
	        miracle.wait_for_shutdown( );
	        return 0;
	    }

	Typically, when you have an MLT object such as a producer or a playlist,
	you can send a westley representation of this to a running server with:

	    Conumser valerie( "valerie", "localhost:5250" );
	    valerie.connect( producer );
	    valerie.start( );

	The effect of the push will be to append the producer on to the first
	unit (u0).

	You can completely customise the miracle server - an example of this
	is shown below.
